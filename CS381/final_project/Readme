This code is written using Python 2.6.x.

To run this, type this in your command prompt:
	python Expr.py

Or, if you system has both Python 3.x and Python 2.x, type this:
	python2 Expr.py


All the haskell -> python execution and demonstration code is written
under the if __name__ == '__main__': line.
