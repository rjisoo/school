\section{Proofs of Correctness}
\subsubsection{changedp}
\begin{verbatim}
Let T[v] = is the minimum number of coins possible to make change for value v.

Base Case: 

    When v = 0 than T[0] = 0 which is the minimum number of coins to make change 
    for zero. Thus T[0] is arbitrarily correct. Likewise when v = V[i], i is the
    minimum number of coins to make change for v.

Inductive Hypothesis: 

    Assume T[k] is correct for some positive integer k. 

Inductive Step:

    For the k+1 will either be T[k+1] = min {T[k- V[i]] + 1} + 1 where the
    minimum solution for k will be the minimum solution for k+1 with the
    addition of another coin. Or k+1 < min {T[k-V[i]] +1} where k+1 has a
    minimum solution that was less than the minimum of k.

\section{Coins Required for Values of C}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph.eps}
There are times where both functions find the same number of coins, and there are time where the functions differ by at most 3. But they both have a similar increasing and decreasing slope over the same values of C.

\section{Experimental Runtime}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph2-normal.eps}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph2-log.eps}

It appears that changedp has a linear slope on the loglog plot while changegreedy has a constant slope in the loglog plot.

Using 2 data points from the timing results in changedp (0.000011s, 9 and 0.015415s, 5000) and plugging them into the equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Slope}
Slope = m = \frac{log(\frac{F_{1}}{F_{0}})}{log(\frac{x_{1}}{x_{0}})}
\end{equation}

results in $m = 1.1464$ which means that changedp is at least $O(n^{1.1464})$.\\

For changegreedy, the runtime goes from 0.000001s for change size 1 to 0.000007 for change size 5000. this means that changegreedy is roughly $cn$ with $c < 1$. This mean that the asymptotic runtime of our implementation of changegreedy is $O(n)$

\section{Coins Required for Values of C}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph2.eps}

In this case, both approaches find the the same amount of coins to make change for each value.

\section{Coins as Values of P}

The only thing that would change in this example is the base for each coin that you would use to divide the amount into.

\section{Coins for which changegreedy fails but changedp does not?}

Yes. Let $V = [10, 25]$ and $C = 90$. Greedy would get stuck because it would use $3 25$ options, and $1 10$ option. This would leave $5$ left over, but no way to make change for it. The changedp however, would find $9 10$ and be able to make correct change.s
