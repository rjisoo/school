Let T[v] = is the minimum number of coins possible to make change for value v.

Base Case: 

	When v = 0 than T[0] = 0 which is the minimum number of coins to make change for zero. Thus T[0] is 
	arbitrarily correct. Likewise when v = V[i], i is the minimum number of coins to make change for v.

Inductive Hypothesis: 

	Assume T[k] is correct for some positive integer k. 

Inductive Step:

	For the k+1 will either be T[k+1] = min {T[k- V[i]] + 1} + 1 where the minimum solution for k will be the 
	minimum solution for k+1 with the addition of another coin. Or k+1 < min {T[k-V[i]] +1} where k+1 has a 
	minimum solution that was less than the minimum of k.
