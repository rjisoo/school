1. 	SCP (secure copy) uses ssh for data transfer, only allows file transfers

	SFTP (ssh file transfer protocol)allows various actions to be performed on
	remote files and directories.
	
2. 	Revision control systems is the implementation of version control in software,
	can automate the storage/storing of a project, logging, merging, and
	identification of a project through time and changes.
	
	They are useful because you can track how software is changing over time,
	who is working on it, where bugs have been introduced (allows you to undo changes)
	control multiple work flows on the project, and provide a way to access
	the changing code over time.
	
3. 	Redirecting is changing where the output (standard out and standard error) and
	sending it to another location other than it was originally intended.
	
	Piping allows you to route information from one utility to another, allowing
	them to "talk" to each other.

4. 	Make is a tool to read a makefile that describes how t build the software
	for a specific target.
	
	Make is useful in that you don't have to remember all the flags required or 
	added to the files that are being built, it allows for targets to be made in
	a series of successions, and can help manage growing numbers of files into a
	simple target.
	
5. 	

6. 	find ./ -type f  -exec file {} \;

7. 	I could not get the algorithm to work, and had a hard time understanding the math
	side.  The implementation in c is non-existant.
	
8. 	Python: see homework1.py
