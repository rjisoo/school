Changes:

1. Change the parse tree data value from the single value to token value
2. Create a parse stack, and feed that into the semantic checker.
3. check matching ints/floats from the stack
4. Change "MINUS" token to be either "NEGATE" or "MINUS"
5. Change tree data structure from named tuple to list
6. Combine binop boolean operators into 1 check
7. Combine binop algabraic operators into 1 check
8. Change main semantic function to do a loop to allow checking of SS
9. Change the way the power (^) operator is stored in the tree during syntax checking to allow for easier semantic checking (^ -> **)
10. Change in the parser how REAL is handled to make sure the number will work in gforth.
