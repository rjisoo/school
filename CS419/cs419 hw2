1.

Assume the 2-out-f-2 secret share scheme is not secure.

S1 is 1 part or the share
S2 = S1 XOR message

This looks like one-time-pad

cipher-text = message XOR key

Let S1 = key
cipher-text = S2
message = message

Since one-time-pad is already proved to be secure from class, due to the original assumption
of the problem, this means that one-time-pad is actually insecure, which is a contradiction.

2.
a) Alice + 1: 5-out-of-8 secret share w/ Alice getting 4 shares.
b) Any 3 people: 3 out of 5 share.

3.
a) distinguishable is x=n-1, otherwise indistinguishable. Does not depend on n. if n is any multiple of 12, indistinguishable.
b) the distributions are indistinguishable if n is prime.
