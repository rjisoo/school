651ff58dbb13b53b1bac330a9b9d3a0097b0b091 created initial homewor4 branch and added a Makefile for it (needs to be edited for the proect name of homework4)
54a2a4e94b74475afb3c0e6dba01e7a642ed5702 added initial code files for the project, minus the planning files
512d11e7ce4f14b74935eb0904e5910ed1fb590e fixed initial bitmask array problem, had to malloc instead of declare
54af411c9f0a258ebc4d43b7ba529963de591235 something happened to my vm install
862923efbbbdf2a146102353e4711351b202e9fd forogot to add this file, now restarting on cleaned up sieve of e file to understand the algorithm
66585472113858a473fe7d1308b64402b2916e9f got bitmaksed sieve working with correct number of primes, time to research threaded sieve
e019d1298bd6f033301778d78cf7bb894beddd31 commiting for safety before screwing up testing odd wheel in sieve
02280b563b7ea69f2aa093d66e2dbe5a87262634 something broke and had to rewrite primes with bitmask. got it working again, not to figure out segmenting and then threading
ebe9cd94105ff313e716fcc967bdaaee14cd4eed removnig file

882b40ddd46c98729f678d0a3f53c24e98d20be1 fixed a logic mistake not caught during the conversion from index to bitmask that caused an error in the number of primes found to be 1 more than the correct amount.
23ef23813a63e9bc9907a084f1e0b536aebf8dfa got input validation working, and changed from uint8_t to unsinged char
adce6e668cc07a191a065fc3fb21cbe38c46bc1d going back to wokring primes file
d92517a764355f486e1cd7e98a1fe4e0bf137b1a finsihed going back to wokring primes files
404b746e67c5c6d68633822f689ec7547a8da320 basic legwork for threads done, need to figure out how to break up sieve work for threads
88610d317c201efd6cb87cf6dcdb6e24e0ffc91c got threaded + bitmask working. Need to optimize counting part.
